# Insurance-Claims-Over-Cars
This is the final project for the fulfillment of Applied Data Science for Business (ADS 505-01). In this project, we are predicting the customer who has claimed the insurance based on the annual car insurance data. The car insurance data were obtained from the Kaggle platform. Team 6 consisting of Landon Padgett, Dip R. Bista, and Subin An will work together to deliver the project. The deliverable will be in the form of Python code in jupyter notebook, technical and business brief PowerPoint presentation. 

The project consists of the following chapter:
1.	The clearly defined problem statement and data description
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.	Data pre-processing
4.	Data splitting
5.	Model building strategies.
6.	Model performance and hyperparameter tuning.
7.	Results and final model selection (and web app presentation) 
8.	Discussion and conclusion

The objective of this project is to select the machine learning model to predict the outcome so that the insurance company can identify high-risk customer segments, facilitating targeted intervention strategies to minimize claim frequency and severity. Future prospects will involve the integration of updated models and continuous injection of real-time data. The solution to the problem enhances customer satisfaction and fosters sustainable growth within the insurance industry. The final model will serve as an important tool for insurance companies seeking to optimize claim processing, risk assessment, and customer-centric policy offerings.
